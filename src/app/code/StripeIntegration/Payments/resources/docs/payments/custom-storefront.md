Adobe Commerce can operate as a headless commerce platform that's decoupled from its storefront. You can use the REST API or GraphQL API to build custom storefronts, such as progressive web apps (PWA), mobile apps, or frontends based on React, Vue, or other frameworks.

The Stripe module extends the REST API and GraphQL API by:

- Setting payment method tokens during order placement
- Performing 3D Secure customer authentication
- Managing customers' saved payment methods

The Stripe module uses the REST API on the checkout page. You can find examples of how to use the API in the Stripe module directory under the `resources/examples/` subdirectory. This guide uses the GraphQL API to build a custom storefront.

{% section id="retrieve-initialization-parameters" title="Retrieve initialization parameters" %}

To initialize Stripe.js and the payment form on the front end, you need the Stripe [publishable API key](/keys#obtain-api-keys) that you configured in the admin area. You can retrieve the key and other initialization parameters using the following GraphQL mutation:

```
query {
getStripeConfiguration {
	apiKey
		locale
		appInfo
		options {
			betas
			apiVersion
		}
	elementsOptions
	}
}
```

{% /section %}

{% section id="tokenize-payment-method" title="Tokenize a payment method during the checkout flow" %}

You can use the [PaymentElement](/payments/payment-element) to collect a payment method from the customer during checkout. After the customer provides their payment method details and clicks **Place Order**, you can tokenize the payment method and use it to place the order. Calling `createPaymentMethod` [generates a payment method token](/payments/finalize-payments-on-the-server-legacy?type=payment#create-pm) from the details provided in the `PaymentElement`.

```
var stripe = Stripe(API_PUBLISHABLE_KEY);

var options = {
  mode: 'payment',
  amount: 1099,
  currency: 'eur'
};

var elements = stripe.elements(options);
var paymentElement = elements.create('payment');
paymentElement.mount('#payment-element');

var placeOrder = function()
{
    elements.submit().then(function()
    {
        stripe.createPaymentMethod({
            elements: elements,
            params: {
                billing_details: {
                    name: 'Jenny Rosen'
                }
            }
        }).then(function(result)
        {
            if (result && result.paymentMethod)
            {
                // Success
            }
        });
    });
}
```
{% /section %}

{% section id="pass-tokenized-payment-method" title="Pass the tokenized payment method" %}

After you obtain a payment method token, you must call `setPaymentMethodOnCart` to [set the payment method](https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/webapi/graphql/tutorials/checkout/set-payment-method/#set-payment-method-on-cart) on the order.

```
mutation {
  setPaymentMethodOnCart(input: {
      cart_id: "CART_ID"
      payment_method: {
        code: "stripe_payments"
        stripe_payments: {
          payment_method: "PAYMENT_METHOD_ID"
          save_payment_method: true
        }
      }
  }) {
    cart {
      selected_payment_method {
        code
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Use the following parameters for `setPaymentMethodOnCart`:

{% table %}
* Parameter
* Type
* Description
---
* `payment_method`
* String
* Use this parameter to pass the tokenized payment method ID. You can also pass saved payment method tokens when a customer chooses a saved payment method during checkout.
---
* `save_payment_method`
* Boolean
* Specify whether or not to save the payment method.
---
* `cvc_token`
* String
* If CVC is enabled for saved cards, use this parameter to pass the CVC token and perform verification.
{% /table %}

{% section id="place-order" title="Place the order" %}
After you set the payment method token, you can use the Adobe Commerce `placeOrder` mutation to place an order:

```
mutation {
  placeOrder(input: {cart_id: "CART_ID"}) {
    order {
      order_number
      client_secret
    }
  }
}
```

The example above requests a `client_secret`, which isn't a default `placeOrder` mutation parameter. The Stripe module adds this parameter for you to use after the order is placed to finalize details specific to the selected payment method. You can finalize payment with the `stripe.handleNextAction(client_secret)` method. Options include performing an inline 3D Secure authentication for cards, displaying a printable voucher for certain payment methods, or redirecting the customer externally for authentication.
{% /section %}

{% section id="order-placement-flow" title="Order placement flow" numbered=false %}

Payment methods of type `card` or `link` that require 3D Secure (3DS) customer authentication go through the following process:

1. The order is placed in `Pending Payment` status.
1. The client secret is passed to the front end to perform the authentication.
1. After successful authentication, payment is collected client-side, and the customer is redirected to the order success page.
1. A `charge.succeeded` webhook event arrives at your website on the server side.
1. The module handles the event and changes the order status from `Payment Pending` to `processing`.

That procedure is the default for GraphQL, but not for the REST API. With the REST API, if customer authentication is required, the order placement fails with an `Authentication Required: client_secret` error. You must authenticate the payment using the `client_secret`, and the order placement must be attempted again following successful authentication. This approach's advantage is that inventory isn't held until the payment is successful. To employ this procedure with GraphQL, edit the module's `etc/config.xml` file by adding `card` and `link` under the `<graphql_api>` node:

```
<manual_authentication>
     <rest_api>card,link</rest_api>
     <graphql_api>card,link</graphql_api>
</manual_authentication>
```

{% /section %}

{% section id="retrieve-payment-methods" title="Retrieve saved payment methods" numbered=false %}

You can use `listStripePaymentMethods` to retrieve a list of saved payment methods for a customer in an active checkout session.

```
mutation {
  listStripePaymentMethods {
    id
    created
    type
    fingerprint
    label
    icon
    cvc
    brand
    exp_month
    exp_year
  }
}
```
{% /section %}


{% section id="save-payment-method" title="Save a payment method" numbered=false %}

You can use `addStripePaymentMethod` to save payment methods to a customer's account. The `payment_method` parameter is the tokenized payment method ID. The tokenization process is similar to the tokenization process during the checkout flow.

```
mutation {
  addStripePaymentMethod(
    input: {
      payment_method: "PAYMENT_METHOD_ID"
    }
  ) {
    id
    created
    type
    fingerprint
    label
    icon
    cvc
    brand
    exp_month
    exp_year
  }
}
```
{% /section %}

{% section id="delete-payment-method" title="Delete a saved payment method" numbered=false %}

You can use `deleteStripePaymentMethod` to allow customers to delete saved payment methods from their account.

For most use cases, we recommend passing a payment method fingerprint, which deletes all payment methods that match the fingerprint. The `listStripePaymentMethods` mutation automatically removes duplicates before returning recently added payment methods that match a specific fingerprint. But if you only delete a payment method by ID, the results of `listStripePaymentMethods` might include an older saved payment method with the same fingerprint.

```
mutation {
  deleteStripePaymentMethod(
    input: {
      payment_method: "paste a payment method ID here"
      fingerprint: null
    }
  )
}
```
